# Speciation-Tool
The Speciation Tool is a stand-alone tool that was developed to generate the factors needed to convert the emission inventory components to the AQM lumped modeling compounds. The conversion process is referred to as ‘speciation’. The factors are referred to as ‘split factors’; i.e. we ‘split’ total VOCs to olefins, aldehydes, etc. The ‘chemical mechanism’ is the mapping of the emission inventory pollutants to the AQM compounds.
